# News_Classification_NLP

The goal is to determine the appropriate category (for example: politics, society, sports) based on the text of various news.

## Project stages

1. **Data analysis and pre-processing**
- Text cleaning
- Label coding
2. **Feature engineering**
- TF-IDF vectorization
3. **Model testing**
- Naive Bayes
- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC)
4. **Best result**
- `weighted F1-score = 0.74` was obtained with the LinearSVC model.
5. **Result presentation and comparison**
- Confusion Matrix
- Comparison table of model performances

## ðŸ¤– Selected Model

The best result was shown by the **LinearSVC** model. High accuracy and balanced F1 results were obtained by using it together with TF-IDF.

## ðŸ“Œ Tools used

- Python (pandas, sklearn, numpy, matplotlib)
- Google Colab
- Kaggle
